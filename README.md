# ChezScheme-clangd
The repository provides the `compile_commands.json` file for ChezScheme's C source code, so that we can use clangd in it.

# Usage - Modify `compile_commands.json`

1. Replace `<path/to/ChezScheme/c>` with the truly path of ChezScheme's C code in your OS.
2. Change `a6nt` to the machine type you want to build.
